# LoadingBarGenerator
This is a joke project, simulates a loading bar that fails.

The bar goes slower and slower over time, stops at 99%, fails, and starts over again.
The text displayed on screen are from the SIMS games.

# Why C# ???
C# 4.7.2 is the core of the project. Dependency Injection is done with Ninject.
And everything you'll see will respect the SOLID principles and the clean-code principle.
