# LoadingBarGenerator
This is a joke project, simulates a loading bar that fails.

The bar goes slower and slower over time, stops at 99%, fails, and starts over again.
The text displayed on screen are from the SIMS games.

## Why C# ???
C# 4.7.2 is the core of the project.

## Can I clone / create PR on this repo?
Sure, I'll be honored!
